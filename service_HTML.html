            I was responsible for grading and evaluating elementary 
            students' homework, assignments, and projects, ensuring 
            accuracy and providing constructive feedback to support 
            their learning progress. In addition to assessment, I 
            worked directly with students to answer questions, clarify 
            concepts, and reinforce key topics covered in their coursework. 
            Beyond grading, I also created homework packets tailored 
            to each studentâ€™s learning needs, helping reinforce classroom 
            lessons and improve their understanding of fundamental subjects.

            I was responsible for creating personalized birthday cards 
            for patients in end-of-life care, aiming to bring comfort, 
            joy, and a sense of recognition during their final days. 
            My role was centered around enhancing their quality of life 
            by providing small yet meaningful gestures that fostered 
            emotional well-being and connection. In addition to this, 
            I also assisted with administrative tasks, including managing 
            patient files, organizing records, and handling desk duties, 
            ensuring smooth operations and efficient documentation.

            I volunteered as a food server for the homeless, where 
            my primary responsibility was to distribute meals to 
            individuals in need. My goal was to serve as many 
            people as possible, ensuring they received warm, 
            nutritious meals in a welcoming and dignified environment.
